# Matlab Dynamic Programming 

MATLAB Code: Solve Fibonacci Numbers using Dynamic Programming, Memoization

Implementation in MATLAB\


Fibo1.m \
Fibonacci with Recursive approach:\
    Time Complexity:    O(2^n)\
    Space Complexity:  	O(2^n)\
	
Fibo2.m \
Fibonacci with Dynamic programming (Memoization):\
    Time Complexity:    O(n)\
    Space Complexity:   O(n)\

Fibo3.m \
Fibonacci with Matrix Exponentiation:\
	Time Complexity:    O(log(n))\
	
	

## How to use

Just run the EVAL.m file to compare run time of three methods: \
	1) Fibo using Recursive method\
	2) Fibo using Dynamic programming\
	3) Fibo using Matrix Exponentiation  (Fastest method)\
