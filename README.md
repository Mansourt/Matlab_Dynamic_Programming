# Matlab Dynamic Programming 

MATLAB Code: Solve Fibonacci Numbers using **Dynamic Programming**, Memoization Implementation in MATLAB


1- **Fibo1.m: Fibonacci with Recursive approach:**\
    * Time Complexity:   O(2^n)
    * Space Complexity:  O(2^n)
	
2- **Fibo2.m: Fibonacci with Dynamic programming (Memoization):**\
    * Time Complexity:    O(n)
    * Space Complexity:   O(n)

3- **Fibo3.m: Fibonacci with Matrix Exponentiation:**\
	* Time Complexity:    O(log(n))
	
	

## How to use

Just run the **EVAL.m** file to compare run-time of the following three methods:

	1- Fibo using _Recursive method_
	2- Fibo using _Dynamic programming_
	3- Fibo using _Matrix Exponentiation_  (Fastest method)
