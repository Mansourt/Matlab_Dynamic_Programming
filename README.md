# Matlab Dynamic Programming 

MATLAB Code: Solve Fibonacci Numbers using **Dynamic Programming**, Memoization Implementation in MATLAB


1. **Fibo1.m: Fibonacci with Recursive approach:**
    * Time Complexity:    O(2^n)
    * Space Complexity:   O(n)
	
2. **Fibo2.m: Fibonacci with Dynamic programming (Memoization):**
    * Time Complexity:     O(n)
    * Space Complexity:   O(n)

3. **Fibo3.m: Fibonacci with Matrix Exponentiation:**
	* Time Complexity:     O(log(n))
	
	

## Usage

Just run the **EVAL.m** file to compare run-time of the following three methods:

1. Fibo using ___Recursive method___
2. Fibo using ___Dynamic programming___
3. Fibo using ___Matrix Exponentiation___  (Fastest method)
