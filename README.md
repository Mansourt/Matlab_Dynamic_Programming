# Matlab Dynamic Programming 

MATLAB Code: Solve Fibonacci Numbers using **Dynamic Programming**, Memoization Implementation in MATLAB


1- **Fibo1.m: Fibonacci with Recursive approach:**
    - Time Complexity:   O(2^n)
    - Space Complexity:  O(2^n)
	
2- **Fibo2.m: Fibonacci with Dynamic programming (Memoization):**\
    - Time Complexity:    O(n)
    - Space Complexity:   O(n)

3- **Fibo3.m: Fibonacci with Matrix Exponentiation:**\
	- Time Complexity:    O(log(n))
	
	

## How to use

Just run the **EVAL.m** file to compare run-time of three methods:

	1- Fibo using **Recursive method**
	2- Fibo using **Dynamic programming**
	3- Fibo using **Matrix Exponentiation**  (Fastest method)
